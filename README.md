# Parallax-Site

This is my first project showcasing parallax scrolling effects using HTML and CSS. 
It features a landing page with parallax background and foreground images, along with sections highlighting various adventure activities.

## Key Features
- **Parallax Scrolling**: Engaging parallax effects create depth and immersion.
- **Static Design**: The website layout is currently not optimized for responsiveness across different devices.
- **Styling and Layout**: The CSS styles define the layout and appearance of the webpage, including font styles, background colors, and utilizes Flexbox for efficient positioning and alignment of elements. The design is visually appealing and creates a cohesive look for the entire webpage.
  
## Usage
To view the website, simply open `index.html` in a web browser.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML file
- `Images/`: Folder containing images used in the project

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
